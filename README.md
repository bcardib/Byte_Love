# HACKATHON
## Inspiration
We were motivated by our personal experiences with negative computer science stereotypes and the challenges faced by socially awkward individuals in large groups. This inspired us to create ByteLove, with the goal of helping computer science students forge meaningful connections with like-minded peers and enhance their social skills.

## What it does
Our app is a dating and friendship platform that differentiates itself by delving deeper into users' personalities and incorporating a unique questionnaire centered on computer science stereotypes. We quantify these responses as 'weirdness points' to better understand individual traits. In the future, we plan to implement a sophisticated matching algorithm that will pair users based on their personality profiles and shared levels of 'weirdness,' enhancing the relevance and depth of connections.

## How we built it
We developed our project utilizing Xcode and SwiftUI, with a simultaneous display of the iPhone simulator to visually monitor and refine the appâ€™s interface and functionality throughout the development process.

## Challenges we ran into
Our primary challenge was designing a visually appealing user interface and ensuring that the buttons and sign-up forms functioned as intended. Additionally, time management proved difficult due to the learning curve associated with Swift, and effectively dividing tasks among team members was challenging.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Acquiring proficiency in Swift rapidly from scratch, utilizing simulators for real-time testing, and crafting comprehensive code for the sign-up functionality were key aspects of our development process. We successfully completed a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) focused on the sign-up process and the unique 'weirdness points' questionnaire, demonstrating our ability to integrate and refine core features effectively.

## What we learned
We have gained valuable insights into app development through our experience with Swift and Xcode. We have learned how to design and implement user interfaces, create engaging splash screens, and utilize vibrant backgrounds to enhance visual appeal. Additionally, we have acquired skills in version control using Git, which has been essential for effective collaboration with peers. Our learning extends to understanding app architecture, integrating various functionalities, and optimizing user experience to ensure a cohesive and intuitive application.

## What's next for Byte Love
For ByteLove, the next phase involves several key developments. We plan to integrate an advanced chatbot feature designed to help users practice and enhance their social interaction skills, providing a realistic conversational experience with constructive feedback. Additionally, we will focus on creating a sophisticated matching algorithm to connect users based on compatibility, assessing personal interests, personality traits, and unique attributes like "weirdness points." Enhancing the compatibility model will be crucial to ensure that matches are meaningful and align well with user profiles. In the long term, we aim to expand ByteLove beyond the computer science field to include other professional areas, adapting the platform to support a diverse range of interests and users. This expansion will be supported by a strategic growth plan to refine the user experience, add new features, and scale the platform effectively across various sectors.
